    <b>   <h2>Formulas You Can Trust </h2></b><br>
    Because “clean" beauty lacks a regulatory definition by the Food and Drug Administration, we chose not to market our brand as "clean." But rest assured, our products are thoughtfully formulated, thoroughly tested, and made to comply with worldwide regulations of quality and safety—you have our word.
     Clear+ Beauty is cruelty free, vegan, and certified by PETA’s Global Beauty Without Bunnies.
